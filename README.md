# CCA-Graph-Theory-BFS-Grid-Shortest-Path

Follow the commented instructions in the <b>BFSGrid</b> class to implement a solution to finding the shortest path in a grid. 

This solution will return the <b>smallest number of moves</b> required to reach the <b>end cell (E)</b> starting at the <b>start cell (S)</b>. 

Your solution should pass all the tests in the <b>BFSGridTest</b> class. 

Use the <b>BFSGridRunner</b> class at your leisure to run your code and test and debug your solution. 

# Challenge 
Add additional implementation so that your solution will output or return the <b>path</b> taken.
